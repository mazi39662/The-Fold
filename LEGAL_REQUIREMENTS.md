   - Make it clear puzzles are generated by Shadify API

**Recommended Code Addition** (if not already present):
```typescript
// Add to Tab6Page.vue or a constants file
const API_ATTRIBUTION = {
  name: 'Shadify API',
  url: 'https://shadify.yurace.pro',
  description: 'Puzzle generation service'
};
```

## 🔧 Recommended Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Terms of Service Page
Create a file: `terms-of-service.html` (similar to privacy policy)

**Suggested structure**:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Terms of Service - The Fold</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: January 12, 2026</p>
    
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using The Fold app, you agree to these terms...</p>
    
    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Fold integrates the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shadify API (shadify.yurace.pro) - Game and puzzle generation</li>
        <li>Open-Meteo - Weather data</li>
        <li>IPAPI & OpenStreetMap Nominatim - Location services</li>
        <li>Various RSS feeds - News content</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Content Ownership</h2>
    <p>All news content belongs to original publishers. Games and puzzles are generated by Shadify API...</p>
    
    <h2>4. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The Fold is provided "as is" without warranties...</p>
    
    <h2>5. Contact</h2>
    <p>Email: cypherstudioindie@gmail.com</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: Add Terms of Service Link to Settings
In `Tab5Page.vue`, add a new setting row:

```vue
<div class="setting-row" @click="openTerms">
  <div class="setting-info">
    <h3 class="setting-name">Terms of Service</h3>
    <p class="setting-desc">User agreement and service terms.</p>
  </div>
  <ion-icon :icon="documentTextOutline" class="setting-icon"></ion-icon>
</div>
```

And add the method:
```typescript
const openTerms = () => {
  window.open('https://mazi39662.github.io/franz_portfolio.com/terms-of-service', '_blank');
};
```

### Step 3: Add API Error Handling
Ensure graceful handling when APIs are unavailable:

```typescript
// In Tab6Page.vue - already partially implemented
try {
  const response = await fetch(url.toString());
  const data = await response.json();
  puzzleData.value = data;
} catch (error) {
  feedback.value = 'SERVICE TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE. PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.';
  feedbackType.value = 'error';
  console.error('Shadify API Error:', error);
}
```

### Step 4: Google Play Store Listing

**In your app description, include**:
```
The Fold - Your Daily News & Entertainment Hub

Features:
• Curated news from 40+ trusted sources
• Real-time weather updates
• 8 engaging puzzle games
